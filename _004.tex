\\
Decide if the two vectors are equal.
\\
\\The vector represented geometrically in 
$\mathbb{R}^2$
by an arrow from point    
\\(-1, 2) to point (0,0) and the vector represented geometrically 
in 
$\mathbb{R}^2$
by an arrow from point (1, -2) to point (2, -1) are equal.\linebreak\\FALSE\\
\\The vector represented geometrically in 
$\mathbb{R}^3$
by an arrow from point
\\(1, -1,2) to point(0,0,0) and the vector represented
geometrically in 
$\mathbb{R}^3$
by an arrow from point
\\(1,2,-2) to point (0,2,-4) are equal.\\
\\TRUE
