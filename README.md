# LAFF_Finally_TeX-notes
=======================
TeX notes for the LAFF_Matlab Repo
=======================

Learning (La)TeX is important to me, as is understanding 
computational thinking and Matlab.
This is a project for learning all three.

I used the TeX IDE for this, writing in LaTex.
I'm learning, and using tutorials and SOverflow as I go
to solve problems and figure things out.

A lot of people I really admire use LaTex.
I think, given my interests, it will be worthwhile for me to learn as well.
