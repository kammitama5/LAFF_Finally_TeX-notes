TeX notes for the LAFF_Matlab Repo
#=======================

Learning (La)TeX is important to me, as is understanding 
computational thinking and Matlab.
This is a project for learning all three.

I used the TeX IDE for this, writing in LaTex.
I'm learning, and using tutorials and SOverflow as I go
to solve problems and figure things out.
